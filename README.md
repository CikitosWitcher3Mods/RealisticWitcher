###Improve the mod?###
Mods available on github, with a neat packing script and all that you can just download and play with it, if you want to learn from it improve it or integrate it in yer own. The script changes are commented with "// modFatigue" so you can find stuff neatly.

###Packing###
Change packing variables to the paths the variables tell you they are meant to be and you are good to go.
Do not (for the love of the lord) make you modPath a path with spaces otherwise it will flop.
